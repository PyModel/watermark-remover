# Ported from wiltodelta/remove-ai-watermarks src/remove_ai_watermarks/kling_engine.py, Apache-2.0; modified: scripts package imports are flattened to this repo's stdlib script package; calibration comments trimmed to the load-bearing measurements (the full cohort provenance lives upstream); the registry mention is dropped (the registry is a later ticket here).
"""Kling AI (可灵AI, Kuaishou) visible watermark detector/localizer.

Kling AI stamps its generations with a thin, light-gray text strip in the
bottom-right corner, preceded by the vendor's spiral logo (not part of the
detection silhouette -- logos vary between releases, the text run is what
discriminates). Separate silhouettes cover the older "可灵AI 3.0" release and
the current IMAGE 3.0 "KlingAI 3.0" release. An "Omni" suffix and a version-less
"可灵AI" remain outside the calibrated pair.

Detection matches the bundled glyph silhouette against the corner. Removal unions
the pixel-derived footprint with the known silhouettes aligned to the winning match
box, then sends the hybrid mask through the shared **localize -> fill** path in
``region_eraser``; it is not reverse-alpha. This module supplies two tuned
:class:`TextMarkConfig` instances (``assets/kling_alpha.png`` and
``assets/kling_latin_alpha.png`` -- font-rendered synthetic silhouettes from
``render_vendor_silhouettes.py``, never cut from an upload).

EVERY tuned number below was measured on the vendor cohort (30 TC260 carriers,
2026-07-21), NOT inherited from Doubao:

  * The mark scales with the SHORT side at ~0.12 of it (mark_w/short measured
    0.118-0.122 across portrait AND landscape carriers -- unimodal, so the shipped
    3-rung ladder covers it) and sits ~0.03 off the right/bottom edges.
  * The CJK gate is 0.35, one step above the clean arm's max (clean p99 0.304 /
    max 0.320 on 286 hand-labeled clean frames). The misses are the faint
    "Omni"-suffix release and the version-less "可灵AI", which score 0.17-0.25 and
    cannot be reached without engulfing the clean arm.
  * STRICT ONLY (``provenance_ncc_factor`` 1.0): the sub-gate band holds real Kling
    variants AND the clean arm's top, so a provenance-relaxed arm cannot separate
    them. No provenance relaxation exists for this mark.
  * No rival margin: at the shipped gate the template fires on 1 of 400
    Doubao-marked frames (still below the gate), 0 of 298 Jimeng-marked frames and
    0 of 286 clean frames, so a rival margin is simply unnecessary.
